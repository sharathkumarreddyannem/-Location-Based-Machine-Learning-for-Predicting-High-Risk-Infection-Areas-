# -Location-Based-Machine-Learning-for-Predicting-High-Risk-Infection-Areas-
Built a spatial clustering model using DBSCAN to detect high-risk infection zones from geotagged health data. Visualized risk areas with interactive Folium maps, enabling real-time public health decisions. Combined unsupervised learning with geospatial analysis for actionable insights.
